# Transliteration
The database is a mapper which maps Urdu to Hindi. The source and target words and expressions are separated by a delimiter<TAB>. Given the homographic nature of Urdu, more than one mapping is possible. In that case, the options are indcated by a semi-colon /;/. 

In some cases, the Hindi gloss is a translation but the second alternative is a transliteration of the Urdu word. Care has been taken to ensure that the data in both scripts is normalised and that it has been checked and validated as far as possible. However the contributor will not be responsible for any issues arising out of mapping.
